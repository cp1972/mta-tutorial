## Install Linux on a USB external device

**Motivation**: You can do all your work from a USB key with a full linux desktop on it. This is especially useful if you don't want to touch the installed system on your computer, and if you have to move from your home/office to other places often. 

**Disclaimer**: this is a tutorial for beginners with no experience in such installation. Follow it step by step, and do a backup of your sensible data if something goes wrong. We don't take any kind of responsibility if you lose your data -- you have been warned. 

In this example, we are going to install a Linux mainstream distribution on an external drive, in our case on a USB pendrive/key. You will need: 

 - a USB key with a minimum of 4GB: we will use this key in order to write an * .iso file to it. This * .iso file is the file of the Linux distribution you have downloaded. We will use this key as the one from which we will install Linux
 - a (second and bigger) USB key -- we will use a 32 GB USB key which will be the key on which we install Linux from the 4GB key. You can use a bigger key, an external drive (as f.ex. a SSD drive)
 - an * .iso file: in this example, we are using the last Linux Mint distribution (at the time of writing), that you can find here: https://linuxmint.com/download.php -- We are downloading the MATE edition, because the desktop is faster than the cinnamon edition, and it is near to what you have if you are working in Windows. 

## First step -- Download a Linux mainstream distribution

  - go to:  https://linuxmint.com/download.php and click on "Download"
  - on the page, that has been opened after you have clicked on "Download", go to "Download mirrors" and chose a mirror in your country
  - click on the mirror site and save the * .iso file in one of your folder (f.ex. the Download folder of your desktop)
  - wait until the download has completed

## Second step -- Write the iso file on your 4GB key

  - IF ON MACOS: download the following free software to write your file to the USB key: https://www.sysgeeker.com/download/wonderiso-for-mac.dmg
  - IF ON WINDOWS: download the same software for windows: https://www.sysgeeker.com/download/wonderiso-for-windows.exe
  
The software is easy to use. You have to:

  - plug your 4GB USB key into a USB port
  - then open wonderiso as administrator
  - in wonderiso, click on "Burn"
  - on the next screen, browse to your * .iso file (* .iso image)
  - chose below "Create a bootable USB"
  - chose below "System File", scroll to "Fat 32"
  - below on the right, click on "Burn"
  - wait some time until the software has burnt the file on your USB drive
  - shutdown your computer at the end of the process
  
## Third step -- Reboot your computer with your 4GB USB inserted in a USB port

  - before you reboot your computer, you have to plug your 4GB USB key into a USB port of your computer
  - depending on your hardware, follow the correct procedure: 
    - ON MACOS: 
      * before booting your computer, hold the the Option/alt (‚å•) key pressed
      * a menu should come up with the drives that you can boot -- chose your 4GB USB key
    - ON Windows: 
      * before booting your computer, hold the F12 key pressed -- on some system, it is the Esc key (mostly HP), or the F8 (Asus), or the F9, or the F5 key; try them out
      * boot/start your computer
      * a boot menu should come up with the list of the drives you can boot from -- chose your 4GB USB key

Troubleshooting: 

  - Windows: there is no boot menu showing up:
    - if at boot in the first screen you see "Press Enter to interrupt normal startup", first press Enter and then hold the F12 key (or another possible one) pressed
    - be sure that you have enabled booting from USB in your BIOS; in doubt, do the following:
      - boot/start your computer and hold the Del key (for delete) pressed
      - you are opening your BIOS -- here is an example of mine
      
      ![First screen in Bios Lenovo Thinkpad](Bios-1.png)
      
      - go to "Startup" (or similar), and in "Startup", go to boot (or similar)
      
      ![Startup screen in Bios Lenovo Thinkpad](Bios-5.png)
      
      - in the boot section of "Startup", be sure that USB FDD or USB HDD is present, as in my BIOS
      
      ![Bios Lenovo Thinkpad can boot from USB](Bios-6.png)
      
      - you can move USB FDD to the top of the list (first position) in order to insure that your BIOS first look at a system on USB keys before going to the windows boot manager
      - once done, hit F10 to save your properties and exit the bios, your computer will reboot

## Fourth step -- Install linux on 32GB USB key

  - at this point, you should see the Linux Mint desktop
  - you can follow this link https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=42&t=287353 and take the hybrid install which is an easy and secure way to install your complete linux mint on your 32GB USB key
