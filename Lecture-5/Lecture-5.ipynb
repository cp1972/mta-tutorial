    "\n",
    "The Nexis Lexis database let you query lot of newspapers' articles, and in this example, we are querying newspapers related to the topic of nanomedicine. This is based on our work on nanotechnologies developed for medicine (Papilloud, Schultze 2022), that we have done mainly at the example of the European nanomedicine. As an introduction to this research, we were interested in the reception of nanomedicine in the newspaper worldwide. As you may know, nanotechnologies have been controversial technologies at the beginning of 2000, and they have attracted the attention of the press which was at the same time fascinated by the possible applications of such technologies in several areas of society, while suspecting that such technologies could also present severe risks due to nanoparticles threatening human health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we wanted to first question if nanomedicine has really made the headlines of the press in the twenty past years, and we wanted to know which themes have been related to the nanomedicine in the press' coverage of such technology. \n",

    "### The data of the Times\n",
    "\n",
    "The Times (London) is one of the newspaper which has been investigated. Nexis Lexis gives you the possibility to save the results of your research in one RTF file, and to download it to your hard drive. We just did that for the articles of the Times on nanomedicine found on this database, and in this lecture, we are working with a sample of it in order to illustrate the first steps in topic modeling with MTA. \n",

    "  2. all the articles of your query with details of the rubric, the author of the article, the body of the article and the date of publication etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we want to do first is to parse this file in order to extract the nine articles as separate files ready to be preprocessed, as we have seen in our first lectures. Let us do it, step by step. "

    "  - low cost in terms of infrastructure needed: you can compute topic modeling with affordable computers -- even normal office machine will be able to modeling hundreds to few thousand of data easily\n",
    "  - you can gain in representativeness with adapted methodological frame, f.ex. doing repeated measures on several batches of data, and comparing the evolution of models alongside these batches; this way, you can gain in reliability;\n",
    "  - the algorithms are public, you can read them in order to understand how they work -- AI algorithms are most of the time patented or under private license, and therefore not available publicly\n",
    "  - you can bridge the gap between qualitative and quantitative research -- topic modeling can act as context variables in quantitative research frameworks\n",

    "## Topic modeling from a technical viewpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "In the frame of qualitative data analysis, topic modeling is faster than other interpretation methods resting on human centric interpretation, and it provide results that fit all cases in the analysis, preventing a reduction of these results to one hidden structure organizing your data. Topic modeling is therefore: \n",
    "\n",
    "  - a method in line with other data reduction methods -- it reduces data to dimensions organizing these data in smaller groups\n",
    "  - a method underlying the complexity of the data -- it does not output one dimension, it outputs several dimension, which are several organization principles, each representing an interpretation of your data supported by the actors/actants having produced these data\n",
    "  \n",
    "Topic modeling is a way to categorize your data, and this kind of categorization is performed by algorithms. This is why you don't have one topic modeling method, but a family of topic modeling methods resting on different algorithm. In the literature about topic modeling, this family has been called Latent Semantic Analysis -- topic modeling is the modeling of such latent semantic structures with algorithms. "

    "## MTA in theory\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different algorithms performing topic modeling. MTA is using three of them: \n",
    "\n",
    "  - Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA): this algorithm by Blei has made topic modeling famous in the early 2000; it works based on probability/statistic models;\n",
    "  - Non negative matrix factorization (NMF): this algorithm renew the approach of topic modeling introduced with LDA; it outputs a model based on matrices of words qua documents under the assumption of non negative element in these matrices; it is linear algebra oriented;\n",
    "  - Word-to-Vector: this algorithm is a deep-learning algorithm which aims at reconstructing the semantic similarities of words in documents based on the principle that if one word has this meaning, then it is in relation with other words having a similar meaning; this algorithm, however, does not take contexts of words' meaning into account -- this is done by more AI oriented algorithms like BERT, which comes at the cost of more powerful infrastructure / computers, and therefore have not been implemented in MTA now.\n",
    "  \n",
    "One of the problem that you have when you are modeling topics is related to the unknown number of hidden structures which you could have in your data. This is what you don't know when you are modeling your data, and this is therefore a problem because all these algorithms need to know how much topic they have to model in order to do their job. MTA solves this problem using other clustering techniques whith which it tests the optimal number of topics to input in your topic modeling. This is the point where you can see how much topic modeling is an exploratory methods: the optimal number of topics to input in your topic modeling is not something in which you have to believe, it is something giving you an indication about what could be a good model. Therefore, this value has to be interpreted, and in order to interpret this value, you need to know what are your data, i.e. what kind of information you have in your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The point regarding the number of optimal topic to model you data is also critical in regard of the reliability of your model. Most often, it is unlikely to take a huge number of topics, not only because it defeats the first purpose of topic modeling related to data reduction, but also because of the entropy of topic modeling. The more topics you have, the more underlying structures you will be able to see in your data, but the less reliable is your model. At the reverse, if you have only few topics in your data -- and providing that you have a lot of data --, you will have reliable topics, but you will loose information regarding how your data can be structured. \n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal number of topics is therefore a kind of compromise between reliable topics -- i.e. not too much topics --, and reliable information about the structure of your data -- i.e. not too few topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "In MTA, topic modeling is the first step in the modeling of your data. The result is a categorization of each individual items of your data in the number of topics you have given. For example, if you are modeling texts -- the most emblematic case of topic modeling --, and if you have an optimal model with let us say four topics, then you will get this kind of result: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic_0      Topic_1        Topic_2       Topic_3\n",
    "\n",
    "car          drive          economics     environment\n",
    "highway      holiday       crisis        energy\n",
    "motor        buy            ford          renewable\n",
    "oil          traveling     volkswagen    climate\n",
    "...\n",
    "...\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make sense out of these four topics, you have to interpret the meaning of each topic based on the words in each of them -- MTA returns the 20 most important words depicting your topics, and based on these words, it should be easy to understand the meaning of each topics. F.ex. in our model with four topics, the first one is related to cars, the second to traveling by car, the third topic underlines the economic dimension, i.e. the car industry and the crisis affecting it, and the last topic underlines the questions about the impact of the car industry on climate, and the way to renew this industry with other kinds of energy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on your model, you will be able to perform other operations, which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - studying the evolution of your model (and of your topics) in time if you have a give a time stamp in the filename of your data -- this is a longitudinal analysis of your data;\n",
    "  - studying the contribution of items in your data to the different topics you have modeled: items contribute to topics differently, and in some case for items which are of first importance for you, it is advisable to see how they contribute to support your topics;\n",
    "  - studying the semantics field associated with the items that are important for you regarding your research purpose. "
