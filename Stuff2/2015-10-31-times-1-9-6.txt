It may seem drastic, but researchers say that drug-packed "grenades" could be used to help cancer patients.
Scientists have developed tiny bubble-like structures called liposomes, built of cell membrane, that can be filled with cancer drugs and fitted with heat-activated "triggers". This means that if the temperature of a tumour can be raised above that of the rest of the body, the payload is delivered directly to cancer cells, sparing healthy tissue.
Kostas Kostarelos, one of the study authors and a professor of nanomedicine at the University of Manchester, said: "Liposomes have the potential to travel safely around the body while carrying your cancer drug.
"Although this work has only been done in the lab so far, there are a number of ways we could potentially heat cancer cells in patients."
The research is being presented at the National Cancer Research Institute conference in Liverpool next week. Charles Swanton, its chairman, said: "Using [liposomes] to deliver cancer medicines has been a holy grail of nanomedicine, but finding ways to direct the liposomes towards tumours accurately has been a major challenge."
