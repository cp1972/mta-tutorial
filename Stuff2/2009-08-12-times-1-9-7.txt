Bee venom can be engineered to target tumours and could prove an effective future treatment for cancer, a new study has found.
During a trial, the poisonous chemical in a bee's sting, melittin, was attached to tiny molecules or "nanoparticles" that then attack and destroy cancer cells, leaving healthy cells intact. The carrier particles, dubbed "nanobees", were also effective in targeting pre-cancerous cells.
Nanobees could eventually replace conventional therapy for certain types of cancer, according to scientists behind the study, which is published today in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. They said that the treatment would have fewer side-effects than chemotherapy.
"The nanobees fly in, land on the surface of cells and deposit their poisonous cargo," said Professor Samuel Wickline, a specialist in nanomedicine at Washington University in St Louis, who led the research.
The treatment was tested on two groups of mice with cancerous tumours. One group had melanoma skin cancer, the other had been implanted with human breast-cancer cells. After four to five injections of the nanobees, the breast-cancer tumours were 25 per cent smaller, and the melanoma tumours were 88 per cent smaller, compared with untreated mice.
