Now, imagine that you are working on your project, and that you already have some preliminary results that you want to share with a team of colleagues working on the same project, or with an institution/an organisation supporting your project, or even to address non-technical readers. For this, you can use a simple dashboard in which you sum up the essential results of your preliminary work. \n",
