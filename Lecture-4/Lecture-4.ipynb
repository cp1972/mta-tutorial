    "## Parse your data the way you want\n",
    "\n",
    "Data parsing is a more advanced topic, and it is a very important step in the pre-processing of your data, because it enables you to clean up your data, i.e. to remove informations that you don't need for you modelling from the content of the data, or that could impoverish the modelling of your data if you keep them. Let us come back to the theory of the modelling of qualitative data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the computer-oriented modelling of qualitative data and other non computer-oriented interpretation techniques dealing with qualitative data regards the workflow that you have to organize in order to get instantly meaningful informations out of your model. The focus is not the same. Non computer-oriented techniques are directly related to the content of the data that you have to organize in categories in order to give your data some dimensions. The computer-oriented techniques are directly related to the _structure_ of the data content, as well as to the _name_ of the data in order to organize (not the content but) the data themselves in _databanks_. Let us define these terms more precisely: \n",
    "\n",
    "  - the structure of the data content: you have to pay attention to the different element of the text, and to where they are placed in the text data; these element can be f.ex. the author of the text, the date of the text, the journal/book in which the text has been published, the text itself etc. \n",
    "  - the name of the data: it is the filename of your data -- the goal is here to rename your data with _tags_ in such a way that you save meaningful informations directly in the filename of the data in order to use this information to sort your data afterwards\n",
    "  - databanks: think about your data as databanks, i.e. as a batch of informations with their corresponding tags in the filename of your data that you can store in folders on your computer. \n",
    "  \n",
    "This way to organize your data supposes that you have to parse your data, which means that you have to take content informations from your data, to use it as tags that you will write into the name of the data, and to save your data according to your research question in different folders. In this lecture, we introduce to this way of organizing your workflow in the preprocessing of your qualitative data. "

    "We are almost ready with the renaming of our original data with our tags, we only have to actually do the rename of our original data into the taged data. In order to do that, we need the shell 'mv' utility which enable to rename files. 'mv' has to be placed before each lines of your file -- because we are working on lines, we know from this lecture that we have to use the sed program in order to do this. The structure of the program follows these rules: \n",

    "    1. call sed\n",

    "    3. tell sed to replace the beginning of each line with the mv command: /^/mv/\n",
    "    4. tell sed to make a blank space after mv: /^/mv /\n",

    "    \n",
    "Now, we run our sed command to perform the renaming of our original files, and we redirect its output to a new file final.txt: "
