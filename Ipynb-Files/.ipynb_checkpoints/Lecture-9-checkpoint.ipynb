Pyvis is a bit more demanding, as is [cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/) which is more tailored to natural sciences. In the same register, you could also use the [graphia](https://graphia.app/) application which is fast and offers 3D views of your network of topics, even if its layout and export capabilities are limited at the moment."
